Developed a machine learning model to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in adults using behavioral and demographic data (UCI dataset). 
Implemented Support Vector Machine (linear kernel) for binary classification. 
Preprocessed data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, applying Fisher Score feature selection, and addressing class imbalance with RandomOverSampler. 
Achieved 100% accuracy with perfect precision, recall, and F1-score, verified by confusion matrix. The model aids early detection of ASD, enabling timely interventions and better outcomes.
